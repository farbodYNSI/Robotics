Modern Robotics: Screw Theory, Kinematics, and Dynamics

This repository contains Python implementations of core robotics concepts primarily developed for the Coursera *Modern Robotics* course, focusing on screw theory and twist-based approaches. It includes modules for forward and inverse kinematics, dynamics, and motion planning, all built from scratch to deepen understanding of robotic movements and transformations. The code emphasizes the application of screw and twist theory, providing essential tools for handling SE(3) transformations and building foundational skills in robotic manipulation and control.
